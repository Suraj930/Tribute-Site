            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni and Mahi, is an Indian cricket player and was a former captain of the Indian cricket team.[2][3] Dhoni is a right-handed batsman.

Dhoni also holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd. after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first edition of IPL.[4][5]

                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni or MS Dhoni is an Indian International Cricketer who has retired from International Cricket.

                    Nothing succeeds like success. And Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a great example of that. Dhoni looks comfortable in every skin he's thrust into-be it the dashing batsman, a leader of men or the assured face of today's generation of Indian cricketers. Deepti Patwardhan reports.
                    RANCHI: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is an ardent devotee of Goddess Durga and makes it a point to visit her temple at Deori village in Tamar, 60km from Ranchi, whenever he is home. Priests claim the idol of the goddess emerged on its own and is there since time immemorial.
